# [rsocket-js](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-js)

A JavaScript implementation of the [RSocket](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket)
protocol intended for use in browsers and/or Node.js. From [reactivesocket.io](http://reactivesocket.io/):

> [RSocket] is an application protocol providing 
> [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) semantics over an 
> asynchronous, binary boundary.
>
> It enables the following symmetric interaction models via async message 
> passing over a single connection:
>
> - request/response (stream of 1)
> - request/stream (finite stream of many)
> - fire-and-forget (no response)
> - event subscription (infinite stream of many)
> - channel (bi-directional streams)
