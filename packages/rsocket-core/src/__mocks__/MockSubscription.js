/**
 * Creates an object implementing the `Subscription` interface with mock
 * properties for inspecting the cancellation status and number of values
 * requested.
 *
 * Mock Properties:
 * - `isCancelled: boolean`: True if `cancel()` has been called
 * - `lastRequested: ?number`: Last value passed to `request(n)`, null if not
 *   yet called.
 * - `totalRequested: number`: Sum of values passed to `request(n)`, zero if not
 *   yet called.
 *
 * Example:
 * Test a subscriber that requests 1 value and cancels once it's received
 *
 * ```
 * const subscription = genMockSubscription();
 * subscriber.onSubscribe(subscription);
 * expect(subscription.mock.lastRequested).toBe(1);
 * subscriber.onNext(...);
 * expect(subscription.mock.isCancelled).toBe(true);
 * ```
