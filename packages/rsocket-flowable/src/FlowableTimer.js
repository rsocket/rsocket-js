 * Returns a Publisher that provides the current time (Date.now()) every `ms`

 *
 * The timer is established on the first call to `request`: on each
 * interval a value is published if there are outstanding requests,
 * otherwise nothing occurs for that interval. This approach ensures
 * that the interval between `onNext` calls is as regular as possible
 * and means that overlapping `request` calls (ie calling again before
 * the previous values have been vended) behaves consistently.
